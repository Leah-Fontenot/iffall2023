        <p>1. My name is Leah Fontenot, I am a senior majoring in Architecture and minoring in Design.</p>
        <p>2. I have always had an interest in coding, but I kept losing steam every time I tried to go deeper into it. I want to figure out how to get over my self-imposed limitation.</p>
        <p>3. I once was enrolled in a GitHub sponsered summer program that taught the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, but that was in middle school.
            <span style="font-size:10px;">(I got a cool shirt from it though!)</span></p>
        <p>4. I hope to learn HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>5. Designing for a screen comes with a different expectation of the result.</p>
        <p>6. I think <a href="youtube.com">YouTube</a> exemplifies effective design. I get stuck there very quickly even if I went there for a specific reason.</p>
        <p>7. I think <a href="https://mycanvas.wustl.edu/">Canvas</a> is pretty effective when the proffessor knows what they are doing.</p>
        <p>8.I think <a href="google.com">Google</a> works well for its purpose. Every American student uses it.</p>
