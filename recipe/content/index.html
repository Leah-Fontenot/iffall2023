        <section class="description">
            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p> Jambalaya is an American Creole and Cajun rice dish consisting of meat and vegetables mixed with rice. It is of French, African, and Spanish influence. While similar, the Cajun style differs from Creole in that it usually doesn’t include tomatoes or even seafood (other than shrimp).</p>

                <h2>Directions:</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    In a fine-mesh sieve, rinse rice under cool running water until water runs clear.
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    Set Instant Pot to “Sauté” setting and heat oil. Cook sausage, stirring occasionally, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl; set aside.
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    In Instant Pot, combine bell pepper, onion, celery, garlic, bay leaves, Worcestershire, thyme, pepper, and 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning. Cook, stirring frequently, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
                    <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    Season chicken with remaining 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning. Add chicken, rice, and broth to pot. Stir to combine, then press “Cancel” on the Instant Pot. Seal lid and set to “Pressure Cook” on High for 8 minutes. Let pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then quick release remaining steam.
                    <h3>Step 5</h3>
                    Unlock lid and fluff with a fork. Add reserved sausage and mix to combine. Top with scallions. Ready to serve.

                        <li>The homepage is full of appetizing photos that link to other pages, however, few of the links on the first page lead to actual recipes. There are different categories to the links but their meanings aren’t defined. On recipe pages however, pictures accompany each step of the recipe which is very helpful.</li>

                        <li>This site is also full of appetizing images, but they do not directly link to anything, the links are on the title under the image. There are a lot of options for navigating, but the search box is hidden.</li>

                        <li>On this website, while scrolling through an article, a table of contents navigation bar remains on the left side. As you pass sections in the article, the corresponding section of the contents bar is highlighted and you can click on the table of contents to quickly change sections. I think this is cool and would be good to try and implement for people who want to skip sections or know where they are on the page.</li>

                        <li>I am interested in the filter/guide/navigation on buzzfeed quizzes that could lead you to different destinations based on your choices. I could use a function similar to this so that users of my recipe page can cater the ingredients to their taste since jambalaya can be prepared in many different ways.</li>
