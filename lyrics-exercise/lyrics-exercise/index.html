                <br>I made a hundred grand this year
                <br><i>(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)</i>
                <br>Still lost, still feeling anxious
                <br>Still worry 'bout the same shit
                <br>I made a hundred grand this year
                <br><i>(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)</i> still lost
                <br>Still feel depressed like I'm tryna
                <br>Find a way in
            </p>

                <bold>[Pre-Chorus]</bold>
                <br>I'm tryna figure this out
                <br>But, my God, I'm so human
                <br>And so I turned to my sister
                <br>And smiled and asked this question
            </p>

                <br>All we wanna know is where
                <br>The stars came from but do we ever stop
                <br>Ever stop to watch them shine?
                <br>All we wanna know is where
                <br>The stars came from but do we ever stop
                <br>Ever stop to watch them shine?
                <br>Or are we staring with
                <br>Staring with ungrateful eyes?

                <br><i>(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)</i>
                <br>Still hung up on opinions
                <br>Still tryna find a way home
                <br>I made a hundred grand this year
                <br><i>(Clap clap, clap clap, so what?)</i>
                <br>Still feel like I'm behind time
